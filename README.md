# Erlang <-> Java on Android using Jinterface, updated example

This repo shows how to use the Jinterface Java library (included in Erlang)
on Android, allowing communication between Java and an Erlang node, launched
locally on the same device by the same Android app.

Run the Android app on a device, you will see a ping/pong in the logs.
That's the successful connection. Huzzah!
